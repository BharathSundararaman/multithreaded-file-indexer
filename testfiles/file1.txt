Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Java applications are typically compiled into bytecode that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

Multithreading is one of the powerful features of Java. It allows concurrent execution of two or more threads for maximum utilization
of CPU. Each thread runs parallel to each other, improving performance and responsiveness of applications.
