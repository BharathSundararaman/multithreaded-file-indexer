Data structures and algorithms form the foundation of computer science. Efficient data structures allow data to be stored, retrieved,
and modified effectively. Algorithms provide step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems.

In modern systems, performance and scalability are critical factors. Concurrency and parallel processing are widely used techniques
to improve throughput and reduce latency. Multithreaded applications can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making better use
of system resources.

Exception handling is another essential aspect of robust software design. Proper exception management prevents unexpected program
termination and improves reliability of applications.
