Software engineering involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. A well-designed system emphasizes
modularity, maintainability, scalability, and performance.

Search engines rely heavily on indexing techniques. An inverted index is a common data structure used to map words to documents.
Efficient indexing allows rapid retrieval of relevant information without scanning every document repeatedly.

Modern applications must balance performance with readability and maintainability. Clean architecture and separation of concerns
help developers manage complexity in large systems.
